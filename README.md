# webpack-angularjs
AngularJs with Webpack

## Requirements

- [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org)


## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```sh
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavbhuva/webpack-angularjs.git # or clone your own fork

# Change the directory
cd webpack-angularjs

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```
Now you can run the app with:
```
npm run start
```
It will start a local server using webpack-dev-server which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Build files
```
npm run build
```
That will generate the final build at /dist
